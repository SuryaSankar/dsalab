In Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) interviews, certain types of problems are frequently asked due to their ability to test a candidate’s problem-solving skills, understanding of fundamental concepts, and knowledge of different algorithms and data structures. Here’s a list of common types of questions you might encounter in DSA interviews, along with example problems:

1. Array and String Problems

These are foundational topics and often used to test basic problem-solving and manipulation skills.

	•	Two Sum: Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
	•	Maximum Subarray (Kadane’s Algorithm): Find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum.
	•	Trapping Rain Water: Given an array representing elevation heights, calculate how much water it can trap after raining.
	•	Sliding Window Maximum: Find the maximum element in every sliding window of size k for a given array.
	•	Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

2. Linked List Problems

Linked lists are frequently tested because they assess a candidate’s understanding of pointer manipulation and recursion.

	•	Reverse a Linked List: Reverse a singly linked list either iteratively or recursively.
	•	Cycle Detection (Floyd’s Tortoise and Hare): Detect if a linked list has a cycle in it.
	•	Merge Two Sorted Lists: Merge two sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.
	•	Remove N-th Node from End of List: Given a linked list, remove the N-th node from the end.
	•	Palindrome Linked List: Check if a singly linked list is a palindrome.

3. Stack and Queue Problems

Stack and queue problems are used to test the understanding of Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) and First-In-First-Out (FIFO) behavior.

	•	Valid Parentheses: Given a string of parentheses, check if the parentheses are balanced.
	•	Min Stack: Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
	•	Implement Queue using Stacks: Implement a queue using two stacks.
	•	Next Greater Element: Given an array, find the next greater element for each element.

4. Tree and Binary Search Tree (BST) Problems

These problems test recursion, tree traversal, and BST properties.

	•	Inorder, Preorder, Postorder Traversal: Perform tree traversals recursively and iteratively.
	•	Lowest Common Ancestor: Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes.
	•	Validate Binary Search Tree: Check if a binary tree is a valid binary search tree.
	•	Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum: Find the maximum path sum in a binary tree.
	•	Symmetric Tree: Determine if a binary tree is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric).

5. Graph Problems

Graph problems assess a candidate’s knowledge of traversal techniques like DFS, BFS, and concepts like connected components, cycles, and shortest paths.

	•	Depth First Search (DFS) / Breadth First Search (BFS): Implement DFS or BFS to traverse or search in a graph.
	•	Detect Cycle in Graph: Detect a cycle in a directed or undirected graph.
	•	Clone Graph: Clone a graph, where each node contains a value and a list of neighbors.
	•	Number of Islands: Given a 2D grid, count the number of islands (connected components).
	•	Shortest Path in a Binary Matrix: Given a binary grid, find the shortest path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.

6. Dynamic Programming Problems

These problems test optimization skills using memoization or tabulation.

	•	Fibonacci Numbers: Calculate the N-th Fibonacci number using dynamic programming.
	•	Longest Increasing Subsequence: Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in an array.
	•	0/1 Knapsack Problem: Given weights and values of items, determine the maximum value that can be obtained with a weight limit.
	•	Edit Distance: Find the minimum number of operations (insert, delete, replace) to convert one string into another.
	•	Coin Change: Given an amount and a set of coin denominations, find the fewest number of coins needed to make the amount.

7. Recursion and Backtracking Problems

These problems test a candidate’s ability to explore multiple possible solutions.

	•	N-Queens Problem: Place N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
	•	Subset Sum: Determine if there is a subset of the given set with a sum equal to a given sum.
	•	Permutations: Generate all possible permutations of an array.
	•	Sudoku Solver: Solve a partially filled Sudoku board using backtracking.
	•	Word Search: Given a 2D board and a word, check if the word exists in the grid.

8. Sorting and Searching Problems

These are fundamental algorithmic techniques frequently used in interviews.

	•	Merge Sort / Quick Sort: Implement sorting algorithms.
	•	Binary Search: Use binary search to find an element in a sorted array.
	•	Search in Rotated Sorted Array: Search for a target value in a rotated sorted array.
	•	Kth Largest Element: Find the Kth largest element in an array.
	•	Median of Two Sorted Arrays: Find the median of two sorted arrays of different sizes.

9. Hashing Problems

Hashing helps solve problems with efficient lookups and insertions.

	•	Two Sum: Find two numbers that add up to a target (solvable with a hash map in O(n) time).
	•	Subarray Sum Equals K: Find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to K.
	•	Group Anagrams: Group a list of strings into anagrams.
	•	Top K Frequent Elements: Given a list of elements, return the K most frequent elements.

10. Bit Manipulation Problems

Bit manipulation questions test your understanding of low-level operations in binary.

	•	Single Number: Find the single number that appears only once in an array where every other number appears twice.
	•	Count Set Bits: Count the number of 1s (set bits) in the binary representation of a number.
	•	Reverse Bits: Reverse the bits of a given 32-bit unsigned integer.
	•	Power of Two: Check if a given number is a power of two.

By practicing these types of problems and understanding the core data structures and algorithms behind them, you’ll be well-prepared for most DSA interview questions.
